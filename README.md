# Decentralized NFT Marketplace

## Project Overview
This project is a decentralized NFT marketplace built to enable users to create NFT collections and auction their NFTs. The platform operates entirely on the blockchain with no backend, ensuring transparency and decentralization.

## Features

### Part 1: NFT Collection Creator
- **Create NFT Collections**: Users can upload images from an IPFS URL to create their NFT collections.
- **View NFT Collections**: Displays all created NFTs in a single view for easy accessibility.
- **Decentralized Smart Contracts**:
  - Each NFT collection deploys a unique ERC-721 smart contract.
  - Uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC-721 implementation for robust standards compliance.

### Part 2: NFT Auction
- **Auction NFTs**: Users can auction their NFTs directly from the user interface.
- **Decentralized Auctions**:
  - Fully decentralized, with no backend reliance.
  - Supports various auction types (e.g., English Auction, Dutch Auction).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Updates auction status and bidding information in real-time.
